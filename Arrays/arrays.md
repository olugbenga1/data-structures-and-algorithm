## Arrays

Arrays offer us an easy way to store list of items in javascript. We can also access them and perform various operations on them with great ease.

Arrays are stored in [] and are 0 index based.

    {
        const friends = ["john", "peter", "uzo", 53, undefined, null];

        console.log(friends[1]); // "peter"

        friends[3] = "anna"; // changes the value 53 to "anna"
    }
