## Javascript Introduction

Javascript is a high level scripting language that can be interpreted and compiled at run time.

New versions won't do new things that the old version cannot already do. What gets added in the newer versions are better/ cleaner ways to get things done which is also known as `syntactic sugar` as it allows an existing piece of code to be written in a clearer and more succint way.

Because javascript is backwards compatible, it is possible to use transpilers such as Babel to transpile code from a newer version of javascript to an older version to ensure compatibility across older browsers.
